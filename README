fconfig is a simple Fortran module to easily read key-value pairs from files.

There are two steps required to read values:

      For the configuration file with the following data:
      	          #comment - this is pi
      	          pi: 3.14159
    		  n: 3
		  message: hello, world!
		  
		  !comment, "true", "false", "F", and "t" (case doesn't matter) are all valid
		  flag: true

      1. Create a config object and read a file
      	 	type(config) :: conf
	 	conf%read_file("config_file.txt")
      2. Get the value
      	     	 call conf%value_from_key("pi", r4)
		 print *, r4 !prints 3.14159

See Example.f90 for complete examples

Default values are supported for keys that are not found in the file by specificing the optional argument "default_value".

Configuration files are specified with key-value pairs separated by colons.
White-space and empty lines are ignored.

The supported types are real32, real64, int32, int64, character arrays (strings), and logicals

Lines that begin with "#" or "!" count as comments and are otherwise ignored
